# Test_Grader
 This program will accept a list of answers and compare it with an answer key.

### How it Works
 A list of test answers that is stored in JSON file is read in and stored in another list. This list is compared with another list containing the answer key. The two lists are     then compared and all items in each list that are the same are appended into a new list and all items that do not match are appended into another new list.
